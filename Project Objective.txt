Amazon Trade Shipping Analytics

Amazon Trade is a global company that ships a wide range of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) to customers worldwide.

Currently, the Shipping Manager lacks clear visibility into operational metrics such as the number of orders processed and shipped on a monthly basis. To address this, the objective is to build an interactive dashboard that allows the manager to:

Select a specific month

View the number of orders processed and shipped

Identify outstanding orders on a daily basis

Analyze shipping destinations for pending and completed orders

This dashboard will enable better tracking of shipping operations and support informed decision-making.
